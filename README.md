## üé® CSS Practices Used  

### ‚úÖ Good Practices  
- **Resetting Default Styles** with `* { margin:0; padding:0; }`  
- **Flexbox Layouts** for responsive alignment and wrapping

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Improvement Suggestions  
- Use **semantic HTML tags** (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).

- Use `<a>` tags inside `<li>` for **navigation links**.  
- Fix hover selector: change `.box :hover` ‚Üí `.box:hover`.  
- Make images responsive with `max-width: 100%; height: auto;`.  
- Keep CSS properties consistently lowercase (e.g., `margin`, not `Margin`).
